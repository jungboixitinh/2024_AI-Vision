## Introduction

This repository showcases various projects developed during my AI Vision internship in 2024. The projects focus on different aspects of computer vision and AI, including image processing, real-time face detection, and more. Each project aims to solve a specific problem or demonstrate a particular technique in the field of AI vision.

## Projects

### 1. Real-Time Face Detection using Phone Camera
- **Description:** The simplest application that detects faces in real-time using a phone camera.
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, Python, Android/iOS.
- **Status:** Completed.

### 2. Real-Time Traffic-signs Detection using Phone Camera
- **Description:** The simplest application that detects traffic-signs in real-time using a phone camera and pre-trained traffic-signs classification model by Teachable Machine with dataset from Kaggle.
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, Tensorflow, Python, Android/iOS.
- **Status:** Completed.

### 3. Transfer Learning Exercise
- **Description:** The simplest implementation of transfer learning for image classification application using the VGG16 deep learning model.
- **Technologies:** Tensorflow, Python.
- **Status:** Completed.

## Installation

To get started with any of the projects, follow these general steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2024_AI_Vision.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 2024_AI_Vision/Project-Name
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

*Note: Detailed installation instructions can be found in each project's README file.*

## Usage

Each project contains a detailed README with instructions on how to run and use the application. Refer to the specific project's README for more information.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my mentors and colleagues from the 2024 AI Vision internship for their support and guidance throughout the projects.
