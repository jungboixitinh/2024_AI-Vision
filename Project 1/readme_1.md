# Real-Time Face Detection using Phone Camera

This project demonstrates a simple real-time face detection application using your phone's camera. It captures video from the phonecam, detects faces in real-time, and draws rectangles around detected faces.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Camo
- Phone's camera

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jungboixitinh/2024_AI-Vision.git
    cd Project 1
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**

    Ensure you have `opencv-python` installed. You can install it using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    python camerawowo.py
    ```

    This will start your cam and display a window showing the video feed with rectangles drawn around detected faces.

2. **Quit the Application:**

    Press the `q` key to quit the application and close the webcam feed.
